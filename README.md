# GitHub Classroom

We use GitHub Classroom for lab submission and automatic grading and evaluation.
The process to set up for the GitHub classroom is as follows.

1. Use the invite link for each sent to you to join the classroom and
   assignment.
2. Link your GitHub account with your respective Moodle username.
3. Clone the repository and begin working on it.

Below is a step by step illustration on getting started.

1. Open [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) and click on the CS 300 Labs
   classroom.

Depending on your submission, you will be awarded points. In the screenshots below, we have examples of two cases, where the student fails some tests, and passes all tests. (If you can not see any score it's possibly due to too many test cases which has failed. To see that go to "View Raw Logs" under the Gear icon at the top right of the page.)
